# Securin-Doomed-Dice-Challenge

Problem Statement: The Doomed Dice Challenge
The below problems must be solved & implemented in Python/Java/Ruby/C++/Go
You are given two six-sided dice, Die A and Die B, each with faces numbered from 1 to
6.
You can only roll both the dice together & your turn is guided by the obtained sum.
Example: Die A = 6, Die B = 3. Sum = 6 + 3 = 9
You may represent Dice as an Array or Array-like structure.
Die A = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] where the indices represent the 6 faces of the die & the value on
each face.
Part-A (15-20 Minutes):
1. How many total combinations are possible? Show the math along with the code!
2. Calculate and display the distribution of all possible combinations that can be
obtained when rolling both Die A and Die B together. Show the math along with
the code!
Hint: A 6 x 6 Matrix.
3. Calculate the Probability of all Possible Sums occurring among the number of
combinations from (2).
Example: P(Sum = 2) = 1/X as there is only one combination possible to obtain
Sum = 2. Die A = Die B = 1.
